Well... I think Coding is alien language.
Why Think? No thought? because 100% is real!

But I'm Remember First Coding

```java

public static void main(String args[])

{
int a = 1;
int b = 3;
System.out.println(a+b);
}

```

`= 4`

this coding is very simply and not difficult
But... my life in Earthquake!
OMG...
